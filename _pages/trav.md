## Resources for Open Data

Learn about the people. These are the "denominators" to any numbers you produce. For example, say you use the [crash data](https://dkt101.github.io/dkt101/markdown/) to find out your street had 10 crashes last year. Is that a lot? Is it a little? We need to use the _travel patterns_ of the people to determine that! If 10 crashes happen every 20 cars, that is a lot more than 10 crashes every 200 cars! This is the power of this page.
