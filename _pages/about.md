This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Resources for Nerds (and non-nerds too!)
======
1. [Draw.io](https://draw.io) is an amazing resource for making professional-grade diagrams, whether it be an idea you have for a new bike lane, or a flow-chart for your advocacy. The Google Drive compatability is amazing, everything is in the cloud!
1. [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/) if you need graphics and icons to spruce up your presentation, or for street art. This is an exhaustive collection of those items. Just be sure to filter on "free" when searching. You can even edit the graphic before downloading! The images can be scaled to huge sizes without ever distorting. 
1. [Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance](https://bniajfi.org/) Great collection of contextual data for Baltimore City, already aggregated in map form. The team behind it is a great resource as well for help with data and understanding the city. 
1. [Non-Motorized Planning Toolkit](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/local_rural/training/fhwasa010413/) Good resource from the Feds for properly planning a pedestrian safety effort. The site has tons of resources for the more technical items too, whether it be the width of a crosswalk or calibrating your exposure model.
1. [Sentinel Hub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) Large resource of satellite data including daily imagery and impervious surface indices. Not the best resolution though.
1. [This book](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/HTML/index.html) helped me understand how data can be plotted on a map (otherwise known as GIS) and how it can be used to its fullest potential. For transportation analysis, maps are probably the most powerful tool for pitching, planning, and evaluating. 

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Software
======
You don't need an expensive software license to be "data-driven". Some of these tools are on the advanced side, but I will try to add tools with low barriers to entry over time. Some of these are web-based. 
1. [NASA Earth Explorer](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. [Google Earth Pro](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) the desktop version allows you to import datasets listed throughout this page and combine them together in Earth. If you just want a quick lookaround, [Google Earth Web](https://earth.google.com/web) exists too.  
1. [R](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for people who like to use Python in their data analysis, this is an easy way to use it. [Help documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation)
1. [Open Drone Map](https://www.opendronemap.org/) If you have a drone, turn it into a mapping machine with this tool. Then you can export the geo-referenced image into a tool like Google Earth Pro and overlay data. 
1. [Tracking busses with Open Data](https://github.com/cylussec/bustracking) from T101 alum Brian Seele
1. [Case Harvester](https://github.com/dismantl/CaseHarvester) Amazing effort by Open Justice Baltimore that lets you build a database of court cases. Identify trends in traffic enforcement. Tons of great research ideas if you can get this tool running. They also have a [request form](https://openjusticebaltimore.org/#contact) where you can request to access their data.

How can I help you?
======
Click the menu icon on the upper-right of the page. You will find a form where you can ask me for help directly, or request drone services.
