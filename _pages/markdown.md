### These links will provide you with a wealth of (mostly Maryland-specific) data related to safety.
#### Crash data are data for all those police reports that are filled out when someone gets in a crash. The data can be very useful.

Prepped Open Crash Data for Baltimore City
:   I prepped some of [open crash data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cuNCBIzq7yR3J6R_taZti_EPfQNUGXb5/view?usp=sharing) for Baltimore City (2015-2018) and added some variables of interest. 
:   There is also a smaller version with variable meanings coded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18pvz3Ax62l-Lq2-L9kg6pyYmmShWmKB_/view?usp=sharing)
:   [Crash Data Dictionary](https://opendata.maryland.gov/download/7xpx-5fte/application%2Fvnd.ms-excel) _beware that the circum_person table is not fully accurate_
:   [Guide to make custom crash variables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xPGsFjn665qHBwsYTYPGGF_R69Xu6wWwKNkjHnQfjFA/edit?usp=sharing) such as distracted driver, impaired driver, etc.

Example of Using Open Portal Crash Data to Find Injuries on a Specific Road Without GIS
:   At my previous job, I had a client that wanted to find injuries on I-495. 
:   I [explained here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CE2IBrPvPK2txDBRobUe9P1w8ZlypKkZfHvGl95N4mE/edit?usp=sharing) that the GPS coordinates can be input anywhere the officer chooses - in Baltimore, that is _not always_ at the scene of the crash. 
:   If you are only interested in a specific cooridor, start with this method, then correct the plotted crashes in a GIS tool (such as the free [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/index.html))


Startup
:   A startup company or startup is a company or temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

#dowork
:   Coined by Rob Dyrdek and his personal body guard Christopher "Big Black" Boykins, "Do Work" works as a self motivator, to motivating your friends.


:   I'll let Bill O'Reilly [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_HyZ5aW76c "We'll Do It Live") this one.
